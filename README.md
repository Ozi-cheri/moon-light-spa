**Moon Light Spa** is a simple multi-page website built with HTML and CSS. It consists of various pages such as a homepage, pricing page, contact page, and a thank-you page. This project is designed to showcase a professional spa service, allowing users to explore offered services, view pricing details, and contact the spa for inquiries. Having worked in the hospitality industry for years, i gained experience in understanding the needs and expectations of guests from different parts of the world seeking relaxation,rejuvenationand over-all sense of wellbeing. This inspisred me to develop the concept of **Moon Light Spa**, which combines the luxurious services of traditional spa with a unique,immersive experience that appeals to both body and mind.
